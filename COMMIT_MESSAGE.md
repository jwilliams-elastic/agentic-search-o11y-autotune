feat: Complete Agent-Driven LTR Integration with Real-Time Reranking

## 🎯 Overview
Implements a revolutionary Learning-to-Rank system that uses AI agent template generation difficulty as ranking signals, combined with traditional user interaction data for intelligent search result reranking.

## ✨ New Features

### 🤖 Agent-Driven LTR Reranker
- **LTRRerankerService**: Real trained model with 21+ features including agent confidence, template complexity, and position bias
- **Novel Ranking Signals**: First implementation using search template generation attempts and agent confidence as LTR features
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Combines agent-driven search with traditional search in unified training pipeline
- **Real-Time Reranking**: Sub-second reranking with automatic fallback for robustness

### 🔍 Enhanced Search Agent
- **Conversational Click Tracking**: Detects user references like "tell me about the first property" and auto-logs position-aware interactions
- **Template Difficulty Analysis**: Tracks generation attempts, complexity, and confidence as novel ranking signals
- **Seamless Integration**: Zero breaking changes - existing search workflows enhanced automatically
- **Position-Aware Logging**: Every search result includes position information for bias correction

### 📊 Comprehensive Performance Monitoring

await homeSearchAgentWithTracking.run({
  message: "Find me a house in Houston with 3 bedrooms",
  userId: "user123"
});

// User says: "Tell me about the second property"  
// → Automatically logs click at position 2
// → Feeds back to LTR model for continuous improvement
